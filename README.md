# Bike Sharing Hourly Data Analysis and Prediction

## Overview

This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) and the creation of a prediction model for hourly bike utilization using the [Bike Sharing Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset). The analysis covers steps from data loading to model training and evaluation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11
- Required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Follow the outlined steps below to execute the analysis and build the prediction model.

### Step 1: Import Necessary Libraries

Import the required libraries for data analysis and model creation.

### Step 2: Data Loading and Initial Exploration

Load the dataset and perform initial exploration to understand its structure.

### Step 3: Data Preprocessing

Prepare the data for analysis, including necessary transformations and cleaning.

### Step 4: Data Visualization

Explore visualizations to understand patterns in bike rental counts over time and environmental features.

### Step 5: Data Transformation

Split date into year, month, and day for further analysis.

### Step 6: Correlation Analysis

Visualize the correlation matrix to understand relationships between variables.

### Step 7: Data Cleaning

Drop unnecessary columns and perform any required data cleaning.

### Step 8: Model Training and Evaluation

Train a prediction model and evaluate its performance using relevant metrics.

### Step 9: Model Evaluation Visualization

Visualize the actual vs. predicted counts to assess the model's accuracy.

## Report

The project includes an in-depth analysis of the Bike Sharing Dataset, anomaly detection, and the training of a prediction model. The report provides insights into hourly, monthly, seasonal patterns, and environmental factors impacting bike rental counts. The chosen model exhibits good performance, as indicated by the evaluation metrics.
